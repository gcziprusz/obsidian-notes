### [Indiana Jeans - Introduction](https://github.com/nashville-software-school/client-side-mastery/blob/master/book-5-kneel-diamonds/chapters/IJ_INTRO.md)

- **Clarify Usage**:  
    Provide more context or examples about the concept linked here: [Line 26](https://github.com/nashville-software-school/client-side-mastery/blob/master/book-5-kneel-diamonds/chapters/IJ_INTRO.md?plain=1#L26). The current explanation is unclear, and it’s not obvious how to apply this concept.
### [JSON Formatter](https://github.com/nashville-software-school/client-side-mastery/blob/master/book-5-kneel-diamonds/chapters/IJ_JSON_SERVER.md#json-formatter-extension)

- **Expand Details**:  
    Explain the JSON Formatter extension in more detail. Include why it’s useful, how to install it, and provide a visual example of its functionality for clarity.
### [Postman Integration](https://github.com/nashville-software-school/client-side-mastery/blob/master/book-5-kneel-diamonds/chapters/IJ_JSON_SERVER.md#postman)

- **Purpose and Benefits**:  
    Add a more detailed explanation of how Postman fits into the development workflow, why it’s useful, and when to use it. There’s clear confusion among students (e.g., in C73), so this would provide clarity.
    
- **Parallel Examples**:  
    Show side-by-side examples of using Postman, the browser, and cURL for making API requests. This will help students see the connections and choose the right tool for the job.
    
### **JSON-Server Upgrade**
  Investigate how upgrading `json-server` to the latest version would affect the curriculum. Some keywords like `extend` and `append` may have been deprecated. The curriculum currently pins `json-server` to a `0.*` version, but upgrading could allow for more modern examples. 
  Not covering the `extend` and `append` features is actually an improvement, as these features don’t have a direct parallel in real API backends
  
### [Location Type Component](https://github.com/nashville-software-school/client-side-mastery/blob/master/book-5-kneel-diamonds/chapters/IJ_LOCATION_COMPONENT.md)
    
- All good
### **Tracking Transient State**

- **State Explanation**:  
    Add a clear explanation of what "state" is.
    
    - **Transient State**: Explain that this is temporary data stored in the browser and is lost on page reload or navigation.
    - **Permanent State**: Describe how data stored on an API/server persists through reloads or reboots. Highlight the difference between the two.
### **Submissions**

- **HTTP Status Codes**:  
    The curriculum currently mentions `200` and `201` status codes. Should we expand this to include an overview of common status codes (`3xx`, `4xx`, `5xx`)? This could provide students with a broader understanding of HTTP responses.
### **Automatically Loading Newly Created Submissions**

- **Custom Events**:  
    Explain why custom events are useful and how they differ from direct function calls.
    
- **Passing Data**:  
    Show examples of how to pass data along with custom events to make their usage more practical and understandable.
