After reviewing the notes so far ([https://nashvillesoftware.slack.com/canvas/D085ACNQ7DL](https://nashvillesoftware.slack.com/canvas/D085ACNQ7DL)), the current version of the book5 already has a solid foundation. Instead of considering a complete rewrite, could we focus on enhancing it by identifying edits and additions to existing sections? Create a plan for changes and  their rationale and share this plan with Steve and the team to get their input. The current iteration of book5 has undergone numerous iterations and refinements over many cohorts. Replacing it entirely with something brand new and unproven feels risky, especially since it can be challenging to objectively measure the success of a complete rewrite. A more cautious approach might be to build on the existing framework with targeted improvements we identified and listed in the succeeding notes. Iterative updates allow us to make gradual improvements over time, starting with the highest-impact changes that deliver the most value quickly. This approach enables us to provide meaningful updates sooner, rather than waiting for an unproven, large-scale rewrite to be completed.

- **Video**:
    - Keep videos short—under 10 minutes.
    - Include transcripts for all videos (ask Steve to enable transcripts on Screencastify).
    - Videos should only supplement written content by adding color and context but should not introduce brand-new information (videos are harder to search for content).
    - We should consider supplying written content to every video
    - Captions  - ask Steve if video captions can be enabled to ensure content is more inclusive.
- **Content Organization**:
    - Add a new comprehension questionnaire at the end of each book for self-assessment and recall practice? This is based on a the retrieval part of [Make it Stick](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJJCfvBqlHk)
		- [Also Uncommon sense teaching](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MwgWnuSlybY)
    - Publish content to GitHub Pages for a more visually appealing and user-friendly experience, instead of just reading `.md` files on GitHub. (The rationale is reducing cognitive load, easy navigation etc.)
- **Navigation Improvements**:
    - Update the main book README:
        - Ensure link labels in the 3-column table match page titles for easier navigation.
        - Add cross-links to improve usability and reduce unnecessary overhead for students navigating the content. 
        - Or most preferably render to GitHub Pages 
	- Consider whether automating parts of the project setup is a good idea.(thinking reducing cognitive load more?)
- **JSON-Server Context**:
    - Provide additional context about `json-server`:
        - Explain that it’s a teaching tool designed to quickly provide an API.
        - clarify that mastery of `json-server` is not an objective
