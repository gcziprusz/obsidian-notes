- **Async vs. Sync**:  
    Consider expanding on why asynchronous code is challenging to understand, especially when contrasted with synchronous code. For example:
    
    - "Execution doesn't necessarily follow a straight line. Tasks can start and then 'pause' while the program moves on to other tasks. Understanding where and when code resumes can be confusing."
    - Could this section benefit from a more detailed explanation or analogy to make it clearer?
- **Technology Relationships**:  
    Add a diagram or visual representation to show how the listed technologies are related and interact with each other. This could help students grasp the broader picture.
    
- **Anatomy of a URL**:  
    Include an explanation of the URL components (e.g., path, query, body, response). This could serve as a useful foundational reference for working with fetch.
    
- **Async Programming Before Fetch**:  
    Would it make sense to introduce asynchronous programming concepts before diving into fetch? Fetch could then serve as a practical example of the async paradigm.
    
- **.then() vs. async/await**:  
    Be more intentional about explaining the transition between `.then()` and `async/await`. Highlight how and why they‚Äôre related, and clarify when one might be preferred over the other.

- **Query Selector**:  
    The video mentions `querySelector` with an ID. Should we add more detail about `querySelector` and its usage in this or a previous book? For example, discuss its ability to target elements by ID, class, or tag.
    
- **Response Status Codes**:  
    The video touches on status codes (e.g., 200, 301, 400, 500). Should we include a dedicated section summarizing common HTTP status codes and their meanings?
