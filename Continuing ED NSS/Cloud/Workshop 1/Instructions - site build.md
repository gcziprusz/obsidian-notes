# ðŸš€ Build a Static Bundle for a Next.js Site

Follow these steps to generate a **fully static HTML/CSS/JS version** of your Next.js site using `next export`.

## âœ… Step 1: Run the Production Build

Build the app:

```bash
npm run build
```

This creates an `out/` folder containing only static assets.

## âœ… Step 2: Deploy the `out/` Folder

You can now deploy the `out/` folders contents to any static host including AWS S3!
