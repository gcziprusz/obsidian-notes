- CS core subjects, such as data structures & algorithms
- Common data structures & algorithms, understanding which are best practices and when to use.
- Design patterns (identifying them and understanding common ones)
- CS skills
- Advanced algorithm practice
- Data Structures/Algorithms
- CS fundamentals like hash tables, algorithms, data structures
- Data Structures & Algorithms for Technical Interviews. Completely absent and it's been the only technical interview structure I've come across. 
- Closest I've gotten was the AirBnb technical test using HackerRank to resolve 2 algorithm-based problem and pass test cases.
- I think two of the biggest things that I didn't feel completely prepared for were talking through my code, and being comfortable with coding challenge type skills like utilizing JavaScript methods to manipulate data like objects and arrays. One challenge was about testing overlapping objects (like testing collisions in a game) where I had to compare two objects where one object was passed into the method of another. If the comparison returned true, then I would store those two objects as a pair in an array. Once all the pairs were collected, I was to iterate over each overlapping pair and output a simple message like "Object "A" overlaps with "B"". All the code was provided for me except for the comparison and the iteration at the end, so it was a fairly simple comparison design pattern, but I didn't realize that until I learned that design patterns were a thing which has since helped me identify other design patterns. Another challenge, an object would be created with the properties questions (an array), choices (an array of arrays), and answers (an array of arrays). The questions in each newly created object needed to be randomized, and the order of the choices within each question needed to be randomized. While my instructor did stress the importance of being able to talk through code (which we had to do well enough to pass an assessment), I feel like practicing that more consistently would have helped me feel better prepared and more confident when explaining it in a high stress/anxiety situation.

- Yes, I was given a coding exercise to compare objects in an array
- Some leet code type questions. 
- I had to use a method in a JavaScript class that was given to me, and use it in a chained for loop to iterate through an array of objects. 
- Had to create an iteration to print only odds. Then refactor to simplify logic. 
 - Find last index on any given array
